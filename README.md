The log represents the commands I used to accomplish Task 1.  
First, I downloaded a csv file from the internet, which contained countries and their capital cities.  
Next, I used the "grep" command to find the capital of a country.  
Because each country has a distinct name and capital, using only grep was good enough for this task.  
I encountered some difficulties downloading files using "curl" so I ended up cloning a whole git repo  
that contained the file I wanted.  
Curl seemed to work when it came to downloading whole html pages, but couldn't download a solitary file from github.
